## Overview

Vatican is a Blockchain web application that stores immunization records with a deep learning recommendation engine for suggesting future vaccinations. 

## Features

* The app is powered by the novel **Blockchain technology** to keep track of patient records in an **accessible but secure** manner

	- Healthcare providers and system admins may access patient records via *public keys*
	- Patients own records (which do *not* attach individual person's name) could be accessed by a *private key* 

* The add-on deep learning-based predictive module, trained on the publicly available Center of Disease Control (CDC) data recommends vaccination to be taken

* We offer a sophisticated ledger of vaccination data, which helps patients keep track of their immunizations so that they can remain healthy. 

* Additionally, healthcare providers gain access to their patient's vacciantion data making it easier to get them the vaccinations they need.
